         <p className="sub-text">I specialize in logo design, branding, and custom illustrations drawn from scratch. I bring ideas to life with a creative edge, helping artists, brands, and businesses visually express their identity. Using tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, I design work that's bold, original, and tailored to each client's vision. Whether itâ€™s crafting a unique logo, building a full brand identity, or creating striking album artwork, I focus on delivering designs that make a real impact.</p>
